/*
CHANGELOG - services/gptService.js:
1. ENHANCED formatUserProfile function:
   - Priority source: gemini_raw_data with safe parsing (try/catch)
   - Rich summary building from comprehensive data (experience, roles, industries, achievements, etc.)
   - Graceful fallback to basic fields when gemini_raw_data missing
   - Added debug logging for gemini_raw_data presence and parsing
   - REMOVED ALL TRUNCATION: Send complete data without pruning
2. ENHANCED formatTargetProfile function: 
   - Primary source: data_json.data.profile nested structure extraction
   - Proper extraction of awards and skills from nested paths
   - Defensive null checks throughout to prevent errors
   - Fallback to existing flat fields when nested structure missing
   - Added debug logging for nested profile presence
   - REMOVED ALL TRUNCATION: Send complete data without pruning
3. Shared improvements:
   - Never mutate source objects (all operations on copies)
   - Clean and deterministic output with stable section order
   - Enhanced debug logging (non-PII, shows presence/counts not raw content)
4. UPDATED PROMPT: Changed to target-centric approach with 220 char limit, required greeting/closing, 3 details minimum
5. ADDED GEMINI FALLBACK: Insurance policy - Gemini 2.5 Pro activates only when GPT-5 fails
6. COMPLETED CONNECTION REQUEST: Full implementation following LinkedIn message pattern
7. ADDED INTRO REQUEST: New method for mutual connection introductions
8. ADDED CALL-TO-ACTION REQUIREMENT: All message types now require CTA at the end
9. MODIFIED: All data formatting functions now send COMPLETE DATA without any truncation
10. UPDATED INBOX MESSAGE PROMPT: Replaced with new human-like, natural language version
11. FIXED CHARACTER ENCODING: Cleaned up all corrupted characters in prompts
12. FIXED DATABASE TRUNCATION: Changed to 40-char limit for extra safety
13. UPDATED CONNECTION REQUEST PROMPT: New personalized prompt with sender name requirement
14. ✅ ADDED COLD EMAIL: New cold email generation with 400 char limit, subject + body format
15. ✅ DYNAMIC CHARACTER LIMITS: LinkedIn message 170-270 chars, Cold Email 400-550 chars with AI optimization
16. ✅ COLD EMAIL FORMAT: Added "Subject: / Body:" output format with blank line separator (labels don't count toward limit)
17. ✅ COLD EMAIL GREETING: Added required "Hi [TARGET_FIRSTNAME]," greeting to match LinkedIn message

* Always end with sender's first name (e.g., "â€¦ Thanks, Ziv").
* Must reference at least **1 detail from USER PROFILE** and **1 detail from TARGET PROFILE**.

* Integrate CONTEXT naturally â€" frame it around the benefit or shared value for the target.
* Keep tone **friendly, approachable, natural** (not salesy).
* Language must be **English only, simple, natural, and human-like** (not formal, academic, or marketing-style).
**Restrictions:**
* Do **NOT** use emojis.
* Do **NOT** use hashtags.
* Do **NOT** use quotation marks unless quoting an exact profile title.
* Do **NOT** use unusual punctuation (e.g., "!!!", "??", "--", "~~").

You are an AI LinkedIn Outreach Assistant.

Inputs:
1. USER PROFILE â€" sender's LinkedIn profile (experience, headline, skills, education, etc.)
2. TARGET PROFILE â€" recipient's LinkedIn profile (experience, headline, skills, education, etc.)
3. CONTEXT â€" the business or conversational goal.
4. MUTUAL CONNECTION â€" the LinkedIn profile of the shared connection who could make the intro.

Task:
- Generate ONE LinkedIn intro request consisting of two short parts:
  Part A: The message you would send to the mutual connection asking for an introduction. â‰¤150 characters.
  Part B: The short message the mutual connection could forward to the target. â‰¤220 characters.
- Combined total must never exceed 370 characters.

Message rules:
â€¢ Both parts must always start with: "Hi [FIRSTNAME],"
â€¢ Part A must end with sender's first name AND include a call-to-action asking for the introduction (e.g., "Could you introduce us? Thanks, Ziv").
â€¢ Part B must end with sender's first name AND include a call-to-action for connection (e.g., "Would love to connect. Thanks, Ziv").
â€¢ Use at least 1 detail from USER PROFILE and 1 from TARGET PROFILE in Part B.
â€¢ Integrate CONTEXT naturally; do not restate it literally.
â€¢ Keep it friendly, professional, approachable â€" avoid email or sales tone.
â€¢ No offers, links, or additional calls-to-action beyond the required ones.
â€¢ Do not phrase Part A or Part B as a question (except for the CTAs).
â€¢ Avoid generic phrases; avoid relying only on job titles or company names.
â€¢ Avoid exaggerated adjectives.
â€¢ No emojis, hashtags, line breaks, or special symbols.
â€¢ If insufficient data â€" still produce polite, general LinkedIn-style messages within limits with required CTAs.
â€¢ Output format:
  Part A: [intro request to mutual connection]
  Part B: [forwardable message to target]
â€¢ Output only the two message texts â€" no explanations, no labels, no JSON.`;

I send you:
1. My LinkedIn profile (USER PROFILE)
2. My Target's LinkedIn profile (TARGET PROFILE)
3. The CONTEXT (business or conversational goal)
Please build the most **personalized cold email**.
**Rules:**
* Character budget: **400-550 characters** (subject + body content only, excluding format labels).
* ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM: **550 characters** - NEVER exceed this limit.
* Optimize for brevity: Use only the characters needed for a complete, compelling message.
* Aim for 400-500 characters for most cases.
* Use 500-550 characters ONLY when additional context genuinely adds value.
* A tight, effective 420-character email beats a padded 550-character one.
* Include a short SUBJECT line — must be relevant to CONTEXT, interesting, natural, never salesy or spammy.
* Email body must start with: **"Hi [TARGET_FIRSTNAME],"**
* Email body must start with an **ICEBREAKER**: a friendly, natural fact from the TARGET PROFILE, recent activity, or a relevant topical comment. It must never feel pushy, rude, or offensive.
* Output format must be:
  Subject: [your subject line]
  
  Body: [your email body starting with "Hi [TARGET_FIRSTNAME],"]
* Include one blank line between "Subject:" and "Body:" for clear separation.
* The labels "Subject:" and "Body:" and the blank line are formatting only and do NOT count toward your 550-character budget.
* Always begin with a natural ice-breaker line based on the target’s most recent and relevant context. It must feel authentic and specific, never generic like “Hope you’re well.”
* If the target’s most recent role started within the last 3 months → congratulate naturally on the new role (e.g., “Congrats on your new role at [COMPANY]!”). The model may rephrase, but must keep it clear and friendly.
* If they were recently promoted → acknowledge the promotion briefly and positively.
* If they’ve been in their current role or company for multiple years → recognize the milestone naturally (e.g., “Impressive to see your [X]-year journey at [COMPANY]!”).
* If their profile highlights a unique achievement (e.g., award, major project, publication) → you may open by mentioning it, but keep it concise and personal.
* If their “About” section includes a clear personal passion or interest (only if unique and specific, not generic) → you may use it for a warm, authentic opening.
* Must reference at least **1 detail from USER PROFILE** and **1 detail from TARGET PROFILE**.
* You may use more than one detail from each profile if relevant and it improves personalization.
* Must end with sender's first name (e.g., "... Thanks, Ziv").
* Must end with a **clear CTA relevant to CONTEXT** (e.g., suggest a quick call, invite to try the tool, offer to send more info). The CTA must always be explicit and unambiguous — clearly telling the target what to do next.
* Integrate CONTEXT naturally — frame it around the benefit or shared value for the target.
* Focus mainly on the TARGET PROFILE — not the sender.
* Highlight relevant common ground if it exists; skip it if not useful.
* Even within the character limit, all sentences must remain clear and complete. Do not cut words or leave unfinished phrases; avoid shorthand that could confuse the reader.
* **Language must be English only, simple, natural, and human-like (not formal, academic, or marketing-style).**
**Restrictions:**
* Do **NOT** use emojis.
* Do **NOT** use hashtags.
* Do **NOT** use quotation marks unless quoting an exact profile title.
* Do **NOT** use unusual punctuation (e.g., "!!!", "??", "--", "~~").
* Do **NOT** use bullet points or lists.
* Do **NOT** use line breaks — email must be a single compact block (subject + body).
* Do **NOT** generate multiple options — only one single cold email.
* Do **NOT** exceed the character limit.
* Do **NOT** output explanations, reasoning, or meta-text — only the cold email itself.
* Do **NOT** use generic AI-sounding phrases.
* Do **NOT** invent details — only use what exists in USER PROFILE, TARGET PROFILE, or CONTEXT.`;
